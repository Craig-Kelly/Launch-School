Squaring an Argument
Using the multiply method from the "Multiplying Two Numbers" problem,
write a method that computes the square of its argument (the square is the result of multiplying a number by itself).

Example:

square(5) == 25
square(-8) == 64
=end

def square(num)
  p num * num

end

square(-5)
square(8)
square(5.5)
